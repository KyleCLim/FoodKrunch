This project is a restaurant website with cart system and online payment features in which SOLID principles were applied.
The technologies used are MySQL, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS, CSS, HTML & Stripe API.

To replicate the project, you have to create your own database schema using MySQL. A folder
named "mysql_tables" is inside the "backend" folder which contains SQL syntaxes to create the empty
tables used in this project. You can import and run it to your MySQL database schema.
